# Vision-based-Pose-estimation-of-quadrotor

 This project presents a vision-based 3D pose and velocity estimator for a quadrotor using AprilTags. The pose estimation leverages camera calibration data, AprilTag corners, and world frame locations to compute the quadrotor's pose for each data packet. Velocity estimation is achieved by extracting corners, computing optical flow, and rejecting outliers using RANSAC.
